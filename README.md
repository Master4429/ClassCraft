# ClassCraft
A massive Minecraft mod that is open source


I want to create a very expansive mod and of course it is not something I can do alone.
I am looking for a team of various skills as well as some others through an open source portal (preferably GitHub)

Here is what I want to accomplish:
I want a class system, something where you pick a starting class like Miner, Blademaster, Grand Archer, etc
A system where you can only use certain items based on your class and you become better in certain areas based on progression rather than having a seed of which lets you find diamonds.
This system could be similar to The Legend of Notch style levelling up but I want something unique.

New dimensions which expand the game going where other mods don't dare go,
My concept ideas include a more technology based world (possible computercraft compatibility) like being inside a computer, standing on circuit boards and taking out bugs and viruses as enemies
A medieval style world with villages, kings, and castles, a possible questing system could be implemented where you take on jobs like going out to find certain items etc. Dark knights and thieves could be possible enemies
A dark world full of shadows and dark magic where massive bosses are summoned such as a lich and enemies such as summoners
A mythological based world with large boss fights and creatures that look straight out of Percy Jackson Possible bosses include Zeus, Hydra, and phoenixs.

I'm consistently thinking of new ideas and here is what I'm looking for in a first release
-4 classes with difficult to craft armor sets
-A selection of pickaxes, swords, etc.
-Possibly the base of the first dimension
-A few new biomes
-About 10 mobs

Here are the people that I will need.

I can code but another coder with a good amount (6 months or more) of experience would be good who can work with eclipse
I need someone who is good with Techne or another model creator I'm really bad at modelling and I have a friend who might be able to assist
A small amount (4 or more) people who can come up with ideas as well as I can't take all the idea credit
Someone to help me set up a GitHub to allow users and beta testers to have their ideas heard
Someone who can texture is necessary GIMP knowledge would be nice as I heard that was a good program

Everyone will be given the credit they deserve but this is something I've wanted to see since TheyCallMeDanger Discontinued the minecraft version of orespawn. If you are willing to help, have suggestions, or support the idea:
